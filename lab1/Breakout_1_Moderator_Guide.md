## Task 3: Individual Assignment on SLIs Using Key Stats

**Facilitation Question:** 
- "Using the provided stats, can you suggest any specific performance indicators for these user journeys?"

**Example Answers with Whys:** 
1. **Search results should appear within 2.5 seconds.** 
   - *Why?* The average load time is 2.3 seconds. Users expect quick results, and delays can lead to frustration.
2. **The site should have minimal downtime, especially during peak hours.** 
   - *Why?* 70% of users visit during peak hours. Downtime during these hours could lead to significant revenue loss and user dissatisfaction.

## Task 4: Group Discussion on SLIs

**Facilitation Question:** 
- "From the SLIs identified, do they seem measurable and aligned with user expectations based on the provided stats?"

**Example Answers with Whys:** 
1. **Yes, the 2.5-second search result SLI is measurable and slightly above the average load time, giving a buffer.** 
   - *Why?* It's based on actual data and provides a realistic target that accounts for potential fluctuations.
2. **The downtime SLI might need more specifics, like a maximum allowable downtime per month.** 
   - *Why?* It provides a clear target for the technical team to aim for and ensures user expectations are met.

## Task 5: Data Requirements & Stakeholder Consultation for Setting SLOs

**Facilitation Question:** 
- "For the SLIs discussed, what additional data might be needed to set a realistic SLO, and which stakeholders might provide this data?"

**Example Answers with Whys:** 
1. **For the search result SLI, we'd need data on load times during peak hours.** 
   - *Why?* To ensure the site performs well even under heavy traffic and to set a realistic target.
   - *Stakeholder:* Web Developer.
2. **For the downtime SLI, we'd need historical data on downtimes and their causes.** 
   - *Why?* To set a realistic target and address root causes.
   - *Stakeholder:* Product Manager and Web Developer.
3. **For the review-driven sales SLI, we'd need data on sales trends for books with varying review counts.**
   - *Why?* To understand the correlation between reviews and sales.

## Debrief (if time discuss as a group, if not tell partipants to think on these after the workshop is done)

**1. The importance of data and stakeholder collaboration in setting SLIs and SLOs.**

**Example Answers:**
- **Informed Decision Making:** 
   - *Why?* Data provides a factual foundation, ensuring that SLIs and SLOs are not based on assumptions but on real-world metrics. This ensures that targets are realistic and achievable.
   
- **Holistic Perspective:** 
   - *Why?* Different stakeholders bring varied insights. A developer might focus on technical feasibility, while a product manager might emphasize user experience. Collaborating ensures a comprehensive understanding and well-rounded SLIs/SLOs.

- **Avoiding Biases:** 
   - *Why?* Relying on data and diverse stakeholder input can help avoid individual or departmental biases, leading to more objective and beneficial targets.

**2. How this exercise can be mirrored in your organizations.**

**Example Answers:**
- **Customization:** 
   - *Why?* While the principles of setting SLIs/SLOs remain consistent, each organization has unique needs and challenges. This exercise can be adapted to focus on specific organizational goals and user journeys.
   
- **Stakeholder Workshops:** 
   - *Why?* Similar to this case study, organizations can conduct workshops with various stakeholders to set SLIs/SLOs collaboratively. This ensures buy-in from all involved parties.

- **Regular Reviews:** 
   - *Why?* Just as we revisited and refined SLIs/SLOs in this exercise, organizations should schedule regular reviews to ensure these metrics remain relevant and beneficial.

**3. Refining SLIs/SLOs continuously is based on evolving user needs and technical advancements.**

**Example Answers:**
- **Adapting to User Expectations:** 
   - *Why?* As users become more tech-savvy, their expectations evolve. What was once considered fast or innovative might now be the baseline. SLIs/SLOs need to be updated to ensure continued user satisfaction.

- **Leveraging Technological Advancements:** 
   - *Why?* Technology is ever-evolving. New tools, platforms, or methodologies might make achieving or surpassing existing SLIs/SLOs easier. Regular refinement ensures that organizations are making the most of these advancements.

- **Proactive Problem Solving:** 
   - *Why?* Continuously revisiting SLIs/SLOs can help identify potential issues before they escalate. For instance, if a particular SLO is consistently not being met, it's an indicator that underlying challenges might need addressing.
