# SLI, SLO, SLA, and Error Budget Cheatsheet

## Definitions

#### SLI (Service Level Indicator)
- Quantitative measure of a service level.
- **E.g.,** The percentage of requests that result in a successful response.

#### SLO (Service Level Objective)
- An internal target level for an SLI over a time period.
- **E.g.,** The successful response rate should be 99.9% over 30 days.

#### SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- Formal agreement with consequences for meeting or missing SLOs. Often listed in contracts and on companies website.
- **E.g.,** If uptime falls below 99.9% in a month, affected users get a credit.

#### Error Budget
- Difference between perfect reliability and the SLO.
- **E.g.,** With a 99.9% SLO, thereâ€™s a 0.1% error budget.

## Framework

#### 1. Understand & Define Service

#### 5. Calculate & Monitor Error Budgets
- Allows balancing between innovation and reliability.

  - Stakeholders: Engineers, SRE Team, Product Managers.

#### 6. Adjust Based on Learnings
- Make iterative improvements.
  - Questions to Ask:
    - What did we learn from our last error budget period?
    - Are our SLOs still aligned with business objectives and user needs?
  - Stakeholders: Engineers, SRE Team, Product Managers, Business Analysts.

#### 7. Communication
- Ensure everyone understands and is aligned on SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs.
