Hello,

To ensure a smooth start for the upcoming SLO Workshop, please follow the steps/checklist below before you join the event:

- For this workshop, you need to have admin access to a (non-shared) Grafana Cloud v10.1.x or higher instance. I recommend [signing up for our free cloud tier](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user?pg=hp&plcmt=hero-btn1).
- Your presenter will provide the details of the data sources to add to your Grafana instance the day of the workshop.
- Familiarity with Prometheus, including its data model and PromQL basics, is highly recommended to get the most from the workshop.

Please reach out with any questions you might have in the meantime.

Thank you and see you in the webinar.
